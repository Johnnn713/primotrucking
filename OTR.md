# OTR API Documentation üì¶üöö

## Business Context: What is OTR? üåé

OTR (Over the Road) refers to freight transportation by road, and it is classified into two main categories:
- **FTL (Full Truckload)**: Full load in a single truck.
- **LTL (Less than Truckload)**: Partial load, where the truck transports goods from different customers.

Our OTR service allows you to get rates and make bookings for both transportation modes.

## Getting Rates üìä

To obtain rates for an OTR route, you can use the following endpoint:

### Route: `{{lfs-connect-api}}/v1/otr/quote`

### How does rate retrieval work?

The endpoint receives a request that includes detailed information about the origin, destination, and items to be transported. Based on this information, the total transportation cost is calculated for different carriers and service modes.

### Endpoint for getting rates

`POST {{lfs-connect-api}}/v1/otr/quote`
